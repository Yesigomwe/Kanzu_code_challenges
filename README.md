# Kanzu_code_challenges
This repo is for the coding challenges during the bootcamp

We are here to answer these questions.
# Question 1:
1. Write a function named fizzBuzz that takes in two(2)  parameters which are expected to be strings.
2. The function should return the string Fizz if the combined length of the parameters is divisible by 3,
3. the string Buzz if it is divisible by 5, and the string FizzBuzz if it is divisible by both 5 and 3.

4. # Question 2
5. Write a JavaScript program that prompts a user to enter their year of birth and in turn prints a string in
6. the console, stating whether the user is a minor, a youth, or an elder. Anyone below 18 years is a minor,
 anyone between 18 and 36 years is a youth and the rest are elders.

8. Write a function named twoSum whichtakes two parameters:nums and target. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

 target
nums
   target
  9. WriteafunctionnamedfirstPalindromewhichtakesaparameter: words. Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".
A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
   10. GivenanArraycontainingintegers,floats,andonecharacterstrings, write a function that takes an Array as a parameter and returns an Object with keys evens, odds, and chars. The value for evens is an array

of sorted even numbers, the value for odds is a list of sorted odd numbers and chars is a list of sorted single-character strings.
Caution: DO NOT use the sort array method
